          <h1>Background Info:</h1>

          <p>I'm 19, transgender <span>(transwoman)</span> and my main hobby is painting. Every picture on this website was painted by me. Most of them are at least 3ft by 4ft, but I'm currently working on my biggest one yet <span>(its 4ft by 5ft.)</span> The one you can see on the right was the last painting I've completed, its of another transwoman who's inspired me a lot.</p>

          <h1>Education/Work:</h1>
          <ol>
            <li>Grant Highschool</li>
            <li>PCC</li>
            <li>A year at a gas-station</li>
          </ol>
          <h1>Why program?</h1>

          <p>I've always been good at schoolwork but college just didn't feel like the right path. After working at a gas station I decided I needed to find a way to make more money and challenge myself mentally. Epicodus was brought up by my dad and after doing some research it seemed like the right choice. </p>

          <h1>Hobbies/Skills</h1>
          <p>My main hobby is painting but I also like wood-working. Overall I just like to build things. In middle school I wired my nintendo-ds to arcade contols and built a 3d-printer. By highschool I was more interested in mechanical engineering so I built a steam engine and nearly started a fire in my room. Recently I haven't had any big projects like those, mosly because of funding, but I still have plans for projects I want to make in the future.</p>
